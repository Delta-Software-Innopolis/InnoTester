start: "Hello and Welcome to the <b>ITP Helper Bot!</b>\n\nThis bot is designed to test ITP assignment
 solutions and help you to find errors in the answers of your program.\n\n<u>How does it works?</u>\nYou
 upload your solution program (.c or .java) as an attached file, and just send it. After this bot will 
 generate 100 random tests and pass it through solution, that got full grade on the CodeForces (reference program).
 Then, this 100 tests will be passed through your solution (probe program), and the answers from both solutions will
 be compared. If there will be any difference between two answers, the bot will send you protocol with the answer of
 the reference, the answer of the probe, and the test that was used.\n\nIf you want to increase the count of tests that
 bot should perform, you can specify this count in the message with attached file of your solution. The number of tests
 should be in the interval [1; 300].\n\n<b>We wish you get full grade for your assignment! Good luck!</b>\n\nEnter
 /refstat to check the assignment number that the bot is currently configured for.
